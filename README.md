Title: Reconfiguring primase DNA-recognition sequences by using a data driven approach. Machine learning algorithms were used for characterization of specific DNA sequences that lead to DNA sequence recognition, RNA primer formation, by T7 DNA primase. Code and data used for all analyses in the paper are included (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.29.317842v2). Description: In this paper, we sought to leverage advances in data science and in machine learning to analyze DNA-primase interactions. Machine learning algorithms were used for characterization of specific DNA sequences that lead to DNA sequence recognition, RNA primer formation, which is an essential step in DNA replication. Technologies: The code contains few steps: 1) preprocessing for the benchmark dataset containing DNA sequences for the training set. 2) Clustering of the DNA sequences and exploratory data analysis (EDA), i.e., unsupervised algorithms. 3) Several regression algorithms for DNA sequences with binding scores to T7 primase; linear regression with L1 regularization provided the best results. To further predict the binding scores of a new DNA sequence, the sequence was assigned to a specific bin (step 2), and its score for primase binding was predicted using that binâ€™s regressor (step 3).
